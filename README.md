# For The Win
The basketball enthusiast's preferred way to track stats for their favorite players.
<br>
<br>
For The Win is an app where you can make or join a fantasy basketball league (up to 5 members) and keep up with the stats of your favorite basketball players. Once you register for a free account simply choose 10 players to be on your team and track their stats on the dashboard. Each occurence of an offensive or defensive stat counts as a single point towards the user's total score. I.E., if one of your players had (4) 2 point shots, (1) assist and (3) rebounds in their last game, their total score for that day would be 8 points. 
<br>
<br>
In addition, each user can view the schedule for all NBA teams on that day.
